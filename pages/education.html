        <h4>Primary level</h4>
        <span id="spn"><img src="../sitepic/primary.jpg" alt="image"></span>
        <p>I joined the school (primary education) in 2007 at kiwelu
            primary school in sumbawanga Region, What interesting is that
            I was so happy with that, I didn't knew that the school was
            not so easy as I thought, Unfortunately enought I came to find
            that the studies are kicking me out, I realized that the school
            is not the important thing to me, But my parents took a their 
            action concerning me, to ensure I love the school and they won.

        <h4>Secondary school</h4>
        <span><img src="../sitepic/secondary.jpg" alt="image"></span>
        <p>In 2013 I was selected to join the secondary level after qualifying
            the primary level National Examination, The good news is that 
            I was selected nearly to the place where We used to live
            The name of the school is Kilimani maweni secondary school 
            at Rukwa region. The life of studies was like a deteriorating
            curve, Because i still did'nt knew the exact importance of Education
            There fore i used to waste alot of my time playing games, watching movies
            and many many alot of stuffs.. But all in all I came out with the good
            perfomance which made me qualifying to continue with the advanced level.

    <div class="division">
        <h4>advanced level</h4>
        <span id="spn"><img src="../sitepic/advanced.jpg" alt="image"></span>
        <p>Life started to so quite difficult in this level where here 
            I was grew up and have a self judgement so there I knew the 
            importance of Education, so I tightened my belt so as that I 
            ensured never to leave this level with nothing..  Though Studies 
            was some how tough but I took time investing in revisions and 
            discussions
