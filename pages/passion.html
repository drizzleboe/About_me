            <h3>Whats my passion</h3>
            <span><img src="../sitepic/cyber.jpg" alt=""></span>
            <p><i><b>Cyber security,</b></i> Once it comes to what is
            circulating in my blood is cyber issues, I've been taking 
            alot of time diging deep to understand the basis and the 
            advanced concepts in cyber security, This field requires me 
            to have knowledge about other Information system fields like
            programming, databases, basic networking and Operating systems
        </p>
        </div>
       
          <div class="division">
            <h3>sub fields which I face in learning cyber security</h3>
            <h4>programming</h4>
            <span><img src="../sitepic/python.png" alt="image"></span>
            <p>In programming, Iam codding in python and I have some 
            basic and fairly modarate projects in python like automatoins
            and web developemnt using the django framework 
            </p>
          </div>
            <div class="division">
                <h4>Networking</h4>
            <span><img src="../sitepic/networking.jpg" alt="image"></span>
            <p>You cant be a good penetration tester if you dont know 
            even the basic of networking, there for also I am investing
            in this field too because I must know how the servers and 
            all other networking device communicate.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="division">
                <h4>Operating systems</h4>
            <span><img src="../sitepic/kalilinux.jpg" alt="image"></span>
    
           <p> In case of operating systems as me future penetration tester 
            and a cyber security expert I have to understand firly deep
            about operating systems, like windows linux and ios
            but whats comes first in my side is Kali linux because 
            this OS offers more tools on penetration testing The fore
            I prefer it the most though am using other OS as virtual 
            machines
